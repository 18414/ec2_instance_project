Note:
=====

0. Please Create keys.yml and add below keys once you created in aws .
   Example: keys.yml 

   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ##
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ###

1. Create .pass file and add same password as you provided while encrypting keys.yml. Please make sure that .pass file should plain text.

2. You dont need create aws.pem file, therefore, it will created automatically as we have mentioned in the playbook.

3. These all files are invisible keys.yml .pem and .pass files. However, I excluded them. All files should at same locotion.

4. Please make sure that all variables should in place as per your requirement like AMI-ID instance-type count & ansible_user/remote_user.

5. Now run main script ./launch_ec2_Create_user_main.sh
